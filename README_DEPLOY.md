English Learn Hub â€” Neocities Deployment Guide (final package)

1) Upload the contents of this ZIP to your Neocities site root (do not nest in an extra folder).
   - Ensure index.html is at the root level.

2) Folder structure in this package:
   /index.html
   /images/      -> all site images
   /sounds/      -> audio files (AI TTS external or local)
   /scripts/     -> JavaScript files
   /styles/      -> CSS files
   /manifest.json
   /sw.js AND /service-worker.js -> service worker files (both included)

3) After upload, open:
   https://englishlearnhub.neocities.org/test.html
   to verify JS, CSS, images, audio, localStorage and service worker.

If you want, I can also prepare a one-click deploy script for GitHub -> Neocities, or guide you step-by-step while you upload.
